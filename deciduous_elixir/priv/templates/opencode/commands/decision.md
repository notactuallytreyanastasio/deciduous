# Decision Graph Management

**Log decisions IN REAL-TIME as you work, not retroactively.**

## When to Use This

| You're doing this... | Log this type | Command |
|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| Starting a new feature | `goal` **with -p** | `/decision add goal "Add user auth" -p "user request"` |
| Choosing between approaches | `decision` | `/decision add decision "Choose auth method"` |
| Considering an option | `option` | `/decision add option "JWT tokens"` |
| About to write code | `action` | `/decision add action "Implementing JWT"` |
| Noticing something | `observation` | `/decision add obs "Found existing auth code"` |
| Finished something | `outcome` | `/decision add outcome "JWT working"` |
| Reconsidering a past decision | `revisit` | `/decision add revisit "Reconsidering auth"` |

## Quick Commands

Based on $ARGUMENTS:

### View Commands
- `nodes` or `list` -> `deciduous nodes`
- `edges` -> `deciduous edges`
- `graph` -> `deciduous graph`
- `commands` -> `deciduous commands`

### Create Nodes (with optional metadata)
- `add goal <title>` -> `deciduous add goal "<title>" -c 90`
- `add decision <title>` -> `deciduous add decision "<title>" -c 75`
- `add option <title>` -> `deciduous add option "<title>" -c 70`
- `add action <title>` -> `deciduous add action "<title>" -c 85`
- `add obs <title>` -> `deciduous add observation "<title>" -c 80`
- `add outcome <title>` -> `deciduous add outcome "<title>" -c 90`
- `add revisit <title>` -> `deciduous add revisit "<title>" -c 75`

### Optional Flags for Nodes
- `-c, --confidence <0-100>` - Confidence level
- `-p, --prompt "..."` - Store the user prompt that triggered this node
- `-f, --files "file1.rs,file2.rs"` - Associate files with this node
- `-b, --branch <name>` - Git branch (auto-detected by default)
- `--no-branch` - Skip branch auto-detection
- `--commit <hash|HEAD>` - Link to a git commit (use HEAD for current commit)
- `--date "YYYY-MM-DD"` - Backdate node (for archaeology/retroactive logging)

### CRITICAL: Link Commits to Actions/Outcomes

**After every git commit, link it to the decision graph!**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add auth"
deciduous add action "Implemented auth" -c 90 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation"
```

## CRITICAL: Capture VERBATIM User Prompts

**Prompts must be the EXACT user message, not a summary.**

```bash
# Use --prompt-stdin for multi-line prompts
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
I need to add user authentication to the app. Users should be able to sign up
with email/password, and we need OAuth support for Google and GitHub. The auth
should use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation.
EOF

# Or use the prompt command to update existing nodes
deciduous prompt 42 << 'EOF'
The full verbatim user message goes here...
EOF
```

### Create Edges
- `link <from> <to> [reason]` -> `deciduous link <from> <to> -r "<reason>"`

### Sync Graph
- `sync` -> `deciduous sync`

## Node Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `goal` | High-level objective | "Add user authentication" |
| `decision` | Choice point with options | "Choose auth method" |
| `option` | Possible approach | "Use JWT tokens" |
| `action` | Something implemented | "Added JWT middleware" |
| `outcome` | Result of action | "JWT auth working" |
| `observation` | Finding or data point | "Existing code uses sessions" |
| `revisit` | Pivot point / reconsideration | "Reconsidering auth approach" |

## Edge Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `leads_to` | Natural progression |
| `chosen` | Selected option |
| `rejected` | Not selected (include reason!) |
| `requires` | Dependency |
| `blocks` | Preventing progress |
| `enables` | Makes something possible |

## The Rule

```
LOG BEFORE YOU CODE, NOT AFTER.
CONNECT EVERY NODE TO ITS PARENT.
AUDIT FOR ORPHANS REGULARLY.
SYNC BEFORE YOU PUSH.
```
