# Decision Graph Management

**Log decisions IN REAL-TIME as you work, not retroactively.**

## When to Use This

| You're doing this... | Log this type | Command |
|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| Starting a new feature | `goal` **with -p** | `/decision add goal "Add user auth" -p "user request"` |
| Choosing between approaches | `decision` | `/decision add decision "Choose auth method"` |
| Considering an option | `option` | `/decision add option "JWT tokens"` |
| About to write code | `action` | `/decision add action "Implementing JWT"` |
| Noticing something | `observation` | `/decision add obs "Found existing auth code"` |
| Finished something | `outcome` | `/decision add outcome "JWT working"` |

## Quick Commands

Based on $ARGUMENTS:

### View Commands
- `nodes` or `list` -> `deciduous nodes`
- `edges` -> `deciduous edges`
- `graph` -> `deciduous graph`
- `commands` -> `deciduous commands`

### Create Nodes (with optional metadata)
- `add goal <title>` -> `deciduous add goal "<title>" -c 90`
- `add decision <title>` -> `deciduous add decision "<title>" -c 75`
- `add option <title>` -> `deciduous add option "<title>" -c 70`
- `add action <title>` -> `deciduous add action "<title>" -c 85`
- `add obs <title>` -> `deciduous add observation "<title>" -c 80`
- `add outcome <title>` -> `deciduous add outcome "<title>" -c 90`

### Optional Flags for Nodes
- `-c, --confidence <0-100>` - Confidence level
- `-p, --prompt "..."` - Store the user prompt that triggered this node
- `-f, --files "file1.rs,file2.rs"` - Associate files with this node
- `-b, --branch <name>` - Git branch (auto-detected by default)
- `--no-branch` - Skip branch auto-detection
- `--commit <hash|HEAD>` - Link to a git commit (use HEAD for current commit)
- `--date "YYYY-MM-DD"` - Backdate node (for archaeology/retroactive logging)

### CRITICAL: Link Commits to Actions/Outcomes

**After every git commit, link it to the decision graph!**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add auth"
deciduous add action "Implemented auth" -c 90 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation"
```

## CRITICAL: Capture VERBATIM User Prompts

**Prompts must be the EXACT user message, not a summary.** When a user request triggers new work, capture their full message word-for-word.

**BAD - summaries are useless for context recovery:**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - this is a summary, not a prompt
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -p "User asked: add login to the app"
```

**GOOD - verbatim prompts enable full context recovery:**
```bash
# Use --prompt-stdin for multi-line prompts
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
I need to add user authentication to the app. Users should be able to sign up
with email/password, and we need OAuth support for Google and GitHub. The auth
should use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation.
EOF

# Or use the prompt command to update existing nodes
deciduous prompt 42 << 'EOF'
The full verbatim user message goes here...
EOF
```

**When to capture prompts:**
- Root `goal` nodes: YES - the FULL original request
- Major direction changes: YES - when user redirects the work
- Routine downstream nodes: NO - they inherit context via edges

**Updating prompts on existing nodes:**
```bash
deciduous prompt <node_id> "full verbatim prompt here"
cat prompt.txt | deciduous prompt <node_id>  # Multi-line from stdin
```

Prompts are viewable in the TUI detail panel (`deciduous tui`) and web viewer.

## Branch-Based Grouping

**Nodes are automatically tagged with the current git branch.** This enables filtering by feature/PR.

### How It Works
- When you create a node, the current git branch is stored in `metadata_json`
- Configure which branches are "main" in `.deciduous/config.toml`:
  ```toml
  [branch]
  main_branches = ["main", "master"]  # Branches not treated as "feature branches"
  auto_detect = true                    # Auto-detect branch on node creation
  ```
- Nodes on feature branches (anything not in `main_branches`) can be grouped/filtered

### CLI Filtering
```bash
# Show only nodes from specific branch
deciduous nodes --branch main
deciduous nodes --branch feature-auth
deciduous nodes -b my-feature

# Override auto-detection when creating nodes
deciduous add goal "Feature work" -b feature-x  # Force specific branch
deciduous add goal "Universal note" --no-branch  # No branch tag
```

### Web UI Branch Filter
The graph viewer shows a branch dropdown in the stats bar:
- "All branches" shows everything
- Select a specific branch to filter all views (Chains, Timeline, Graph, DAG)

### When to Use Branch Grouping
- **Feature work**: Nodes created on `feature-auth` branch auto-grouped
- **PR context**: Filter to see only decisions for a specific PR
- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Use `--no-branch` for universal notes
- **Retrospectives**: Filter by branch to see decision history per feature

### Create Edges
- `link <from> <to> [reason]` -> `deciduous link <from> <to> -r "<reason>"`

### Sync Graph
- `sync` -> `deciduous sync`

### Multi-User Sync (Diff/Patch)
- `diff export -o <file>` -> `deciduous diff export -o <file>` (export nodes as patch)
- `diff export --nodes 1-10 -o <file>` -> export specific nodes
- `diff export --branch feature-x -o <file>` -> export nodes from branch
- `diff apply <file>` -> `deciduous diff apply <file>` (apply patch, idempotent)
- `diff apply --dry-run <file>` -> preview without applying
- `diff status` -> `deciduous diff status` (list patches in .deciduous/patches/)
- `migrate` -> `deciduous migrate` (add change_id columns for sync)

### Export & Visualization
- `dot` -> `deciduous dot` (output DOT to stdout)
- `dot --png` -> `deciduous dot --png -o graph.dot` (generate PNG)
- `dot --nodes 1-11` -> `deciduous dot --nodes 1-11` (filter nodes)
- `writeup` -> `deciduous writeup` (generate PR writeup)
- `writeup -t "Title" --nodes 1-11` -> filtered writeup

## Node Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `goal` | High-level objective | "Add user authentication" |
| `decision` | Choice point with options | "Choose auth method" |
| `option` | Possible approach | "Use JWT tokens" |
| `action` | Something implemented | "Added JWT middleware" |
| `outcome` | Result of action | "JWT auth working" |
| `observation` | Finding or data point | "Existing code uses sessions" |

## Edge Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `leads_to` | Natural progression |
| `chosen` | Selected option |
| `rejected` | Not selected (include reason!) |
| `requires` | Dependency |
| `blocks` | Preventing progress |
| `enables` | Makes something possible |

## Graph Integrity - CRITICAL

**Every node MUST be logically connected.** Floating nodes break the graph's value.

### Connection Rules
| Node Type | MUST connect to | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `outcome` | The action/goal it resolves | "JWT working" -> links FROM "Implementing JWT" |
| `action` | The decision/goal that spawned it | "Implementing JWT" -> links FROM "Add auth" |
| `option` | Its parent decision | "Use JWT" -> links FROM "Choose auth method" |
| `observation` | Related goal/action/decision | "Found existing code" -> links TO relevant node |
| `decision` | Parent goal (if any) | "Choose auth" -> links FROM "Add auth feature" |
| `goal` | Can be a root (no parent needed) | Root goals are valid orphans |

### Audit Checklist
Ask yourself after creating nodes:
1. Does every **outcome** link back to what caused it?
2. Does every **action** link to why you did it?
3. Does every **option** link to its decision?
4. Are there **dangling outcomes** with no parent action/goal?

### Find Disconnected Nodes
```bash
# List nodes with no incoming edges (potential orphans)
deciduous edges | cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort -u > /tmp/has_parent.txt
deciduous nodes | tail -n+3 | awk '{print $1}' | while read id; do
  grep -q "^$id$" /tmp/has_parent.txt || echo "CHECK: $id"
done
```
Note: Root goals are VALID orphans. Outcomes/actions/options usually are NOT.

### Fix Missing Connections
```bash
deciduous link <parent_id> <child_id> -r "Retroactive connection - <why>"
```

### When to Audit
- Before every `deciduous sync`
- After creating multiple nodes quickly
- At session end
- When the web UI graph looks disconnected

## Multi-User Sync

**Problem**: Multiple users work on the same codebase, each with a local `.deciduous/deciduous.db` (gitignored). How to share decisions?

**Solution**: jj-inspired dual-ID model. Each node has:
- `id` (integer): Local database primary key, different per machine
- `change_id` (UUID): Globally unique, stable across all databases

### Export Workflow
```bash
# Export nodes from your branch as a patch file
deciduous diff export --branch feature-x -o .deciduous/patches/alice-feature.json

# Or export specific node IDs
deciduous diff export --nodes 172-188 -o .deciduous/patches/alice-feature.json --author alice
```

### Apply Workflow
```bash
# Apply patches from teammates (idempotent - safe to re-apply)
deciduous diff apply .deciduous/patches/*.json

# Preview what would change
deciduous diff apply --dry-run .deciduous/patches/bob-refactor.json
```

### PR Workflow
1. Create nodes locally while working
2. Export: `deciduous diff export --branch my-feature -o .deciduous/patches/my-feature.json`
3. Commit the patch file (NOT the database)
4. Open PR with patch file included
5. Teammates pull and apply: `deciduous diff apply .deciduous/patches/my-feature.json`
6. **Idempotent**: Same patch applied twice = no duplicates

### Patch Format (JSON)
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "author": "alice",
  "branch": "feature/auth",
  "nodes": [{ "change_id": "uuid...", "title": "...", ... }],
  "edges": [{ "from_change_id": "uuid1", "to_change_id": "uuid2", ... }]
}
```

## The Rule

```
LOG BEFORE YOU CODE, NOT AFTER.
CONNECT EVERY NODE TO ITS PARENT.
AUDIT FOR ORPHANS REGULARLY.
SYNC BEFORE YOU PUSH.
EXPORT PATCHES FOR YOUR TEAMMATES.
```

description: Recover context from decision graph and recent activity - USE THIS ON SESSION START
allowed-tools: Bash(deciduous:*, git:*, cat:*, tail:*)
argument-hint: [focus-area]
---

# Context Recovery

**RUN THIS AT SESSION START.** The decision graph is your persistent memory.

## Step 1: Query the Graph

```bash
# See all decisions (look for recent ones and pending status)
deciduous nodes

# Filter by current branch (useful for feature work)
deciduous nodes --branch $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# See how decisions connect
deciduous edges

# What commands were recently run?
deciduous commands
```

**Branch-scoped context**: If working on a feature branch, filter nodes to see only decisions relevant to this branch. Main branch nodes are tagged with `[branch: main]`.

## Step 1.5: Audit Graph Integrity

**CRITICAL: Check that all nodes are logically connected.**

```bash
# Find nodes with no incoming edges (potential missing connections)
deciduous edges | cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort -u > /tmp/has_parent.txt
deciduous nodes | tail -n+3 | awk '{print $1}' | while read id; do
  grep -q "^$id$" /tmp/has_parent.txt || echo "CHECK: $id"
done
```

**Review each flagged node:**
- Root `goal` nodes are VALID without parents
- `outcome` nodes MUST link back to their action/goal
- `action` nodes MUST link to their parent goal/decision
- `option` nodes MUST link to their parent decision

**Fix missing connections:**
```bash
deciduous link <parent_id> <child_id> -r "Retroactive connection - <reason>"
```

## Step 2: Check Git State

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -10
git diff --stat
```

## Step 3: Check Session Log

```bash
cat git.log | tail -30
```

## After Gathering Context, Report:

1. **Current branch** and pending changes
2. **Branch-specific decisions** (filter by branch if on feature branch)
3. **Recent decisions** (especially pending/active ones)
4. **Last actions** from git log and command log
5. **Open questions** or unresolved observations
6. **Suggested next steps**

### Branch Configuration

Check `.deciduous/config.toml` for branch settings:
```toml
[branch]
main_branches = ["main", "master"]  # Which branches are "main"
auto_detect = true                    # Auto-detect branch on node creation
```

---

## REMEMBER: Real-Time Logging Required

After recovering context, you MUST follow the logging workflow:

```
EVERY USER REQUEST -> Log goal/decision first
BEFORE CODE CHANGES -> Log action
AFTER CHANGES -> Log outcome, link nodes
BEFORE GIT PUSH -> deciduous sync
```

**The user is watching the graph live.** Log as you go, not after.

### Quick Logging Commands

```bash
# Root goal with user prompt (capture what the user asked for)
deciduous add goal "What we're trying to do" -c 90 -p "User asked: <their request>"

deciduous add action "What I'm about to implement" -c 85
deciduous add outcome "What happened" -c 95
deciduous link FROM TO -r "Connection reason"

# Capture prompt when user redirects mid-stream
deciduous add action "Switching approach" -c 85 -p "User said: use X instead"

deciduous sync  # Do this frequently!
```

**When to use `--prompt`:** On root goals (always) and when user gives new direction mid-stream. Downstream nodes inherit context via edges.

---

## Focus Areas

If $ARGUMENTS specifies a focus, prioritize context for:

- **auth**: Authentication-related decisions
- **ui** / **graph**: UI and graph viewer state
- **cli**: Command-line interface changes
- **api**: API endpoints and data structures

---

## The Memory Loop

```
SESSION START
    |
Run /recover -> See past decisions
    |
AUDIT -> Fix any orphan nodes first!
    |
DO WORK -> Log BEFORE each action
    |
CONNECT -> Link new nodes immediately
    |
AFTER CHANGES -> Log outcomes, observations
    |
AUDIT AGAIN -> Any new orphans?
    |
BEFORE PUSH -> deciduous sync
    |
PUSH -> Live graph updates
    |
SESSION END -> Final audit
    |
(repeat)
```

**Live graph**: https://notactuallytreyanastasio.github.io/deciduous/

---

## Multi-User Sync

If working in a team, check for and apply patches from teammates:

```bash
# Check for unapplied patches
deciduous diff status

# Apply all patches (idempotent - safe to run multiple times)
deciduous diff apply .deciduous/patches/*.json

# Preview before applying
deciduous diff apply --dry-run .deciduous/patches/teammate-feature.json
```

Before pushing your branch, export your decisions for teammates:

```bash
# Export your branch's decisions as a patch
deciduous diff export --branch $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) \
  -o .deciduous/patches/$(whoami)-$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD).json

# Commit the patch file
git add .deciduous/patches/
```

## Why This Matters

- Context loss during compaction loses your reasoning
- The graph survives - query it early, query it often
- Retroactive logging misses details - log in the moment
- The user sees the graph live - show your work
- Patches share reasoning with teammates
"#;

/// CLAUDE.md section to append for decision graph workflow
pub const CLAUDE_MD_SECTION: &str = r#"
## Decision Graph Workflow

**THIS IS MANDATORY. Log decisions IN REAL-TIME, not retroactively.**

### The Core Rule

```
BEFORE you do something -> Log what you're ABOUT to do
AFTER it succeeds/fails -> Log the outcome
CONNECT immediately -> Link every node to its parent
AUDIT regularly -> Check for missing connections
```

### Behavioral Triggers - MUST LOG WHEN:

| Trigger | Log Type | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| User asks for a new feature | `goal` **with -p** | "Add dark mode" |
| Choosing between approaches | `decision` | "Choose state management" |
| About to write/edit code | `action` | "Implementing Redux store" |
| Something worked or failed | `outcome` | "Redux integration successful" |
| Notice something interesting | `observation` | "Existing code uses hooks" |

### CRITICAL: Capture VERBATIM User Prompts

**Prompts must be the EXACT user message, not a summary.** When a user request triggers new work, capture their full message word-for-word.

**BAD - summaries are useless for context recovery:**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - this is a summary, not a prompt
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -p "User asked: add login to the app"
```

**GOOD - verbatim prompts enable full context recovery:**
```bash
# Use --prompt-stdin for multi-line prompts
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
I need to add user authentication to the app. Users should be able to sign up
with email/password, and we need OAuth support for Google and GitHub. The auth
should use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation.
EOF

# Or use the prompt command to update existing nodes
deciduous prompt 42 << 'EOF'
The full verbatim user message goes here...
EOF
```

**When to capture prompts:**
- Root `goal` nodes: YES - the FULL original request
- Major direction changes: YES - when user redirects the work
- Routine downstream nodes: NO - they inherit context via edges

**Updating prompts on existing nodes:**
```bash
deciduous prompt <node_id> "full verbatim prompt here"
cat prompt.txt | deciduous prompt <node_id>  # Multi-line from stdin
```

Prompts are viewable in the TUI detail panel (`deciduous tui`) and web viewer.

### CRITICAL: Maintain Connections

**The graph's value is in its CONNECTIONS, not just nodes.**

| When you create... | IMMEDIATELY link to... |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `outcome` | The action/goal it resolves |
| `action` | The goal/decision that spawned it |
| `option` | Its parent decision |
| `observation` | Related goal/action |

**Root `goal` nodes are the ONLY valid orphans.**

### Quick Commands

```bash
deciduous add goal "Title" -c 90 -p "User's original request"
deciduous add action "Title" -c 85
deciduous link FROM TO -r "reason"  # DO THIS IMMEDIATELY!
deciduous serve   # View live (auto-refreshes every 30s)
deciduous sync    # Export for static hosting

# Metadata flags
# -c, --confidence 0-100   Confidence level
# -p, --prompt "..."       Store the user prompt (use when semantically meaningful)
# -f, --files "a.rs,b.rs"  Associate files
# -b, --branch <name>      Git branch (auto-detected)
# --commit <hash|HEAD>     Link to git commit (use HEAD for current commit)
# --date "YYYY-MM-DD"      Backdate node (for archaeology)

# Branch filtering
deciduous nodes --branch main
deciduous nodes -b feature-auth
```

### CRITICAL: Link Commits to Actions/Outcomes

**After every git commit, link it to the decision graph!**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add auth"
deciduous add action "Implemented auth" -c 90 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation"
```

The `--commit HEAD` flag captures the commit hash and links it to the node. The web viewer will show commit messages, authors, and dates.

### Git History & Deployment

```bash
# Export graph AND git history for web viewer
deciduous sync

# This creates:
# - docs/graph-data.json (decision graph)
# - docs/git-history.json (commit info for linked nodes)
```

To deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. `deciduous sync` to export
2. Push to GitHub
3. Settings > Pages > Deploy from branch > /docs folder

Your graph will be live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`

### Branch-Based Grouping

Nodes are auto-tagged with the current git branch. Configure in `.deciduous/config.toml`:
```toml
[branch]
main_branches = ["main", "master"]
auto_detect = true
```

### Audit Checklist (Before Every Sync)

1. Does every **outcome** link back to what caused it?
2. Does every **action** link to why you did it?
3. Any **dangling outcomes** without parents?

### Session Start Checklist

```bash
deciduous nodes    # What decisions exist?
deciduous edges    # How are they connected? Any gaps?
git status         # Current state
```

### Multi-User Sync

Share decisions across teammates:

```bash
# Export your branch's decisions
deciduous diff export --branch feature-x -o .deciduous/patches/my-feature.json

# Apply patches from teammates (idempotent)
deciduous diff apply .deciduous/patches/*.json

# Preview before applying
deciduous diff apply --dry-run .deciduous/patches/teammate.json
```

PR workflow: Export patch -> commit patch file -> PR -> teammates apply.

description: Start a work transaction - creates goal node BEFORE any implementation
allowed-tools: Bash(deciduous:*)
argument-hint: <goal title>
---

# Work Transaction

**USE THIS BEFORE STARTING ANY IMPLEMENTATION.**

This skill creates the required deciduous nodes BEFORE you write any code. The Edit/Write hooks will BLOCK you if you don't have a recent node.

## Step 1: Create the Goal Node

Based on $ARGUMENTS (or the user's most recent request), create a goal node:

```bash
# Create goal with the user's request captured verbatim
deciduous add goal "$ARGUMENTS" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
[INSERT THE EXACT USER REQUEST HERE - VERBATIM, NOT SUMMARIZED]
EOF
```

**IMPORTANT**: The prompt must be the user's EXACT words, not your summary.

## Step 2: Announce the Goal ID

After creating the goal, tell the user:
- The goal ID that was created
- What you're about to implement
- That you'll create action nodes as you work

## Step 3: Before Each Major Edit

Before editing files, create an action node:

```bash
deciduous add action "What you're about to implement" -c 85 -f "file1.rs,file2.rs"
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation step"
```

## Step 4: After Completion

When the work is done:

```bash
# After committing
deciduous add outcome "What was accomplished" -c 95 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <action_id> <outcome_id> -r "Implementation complete"

# Sync the graph
deciduous sync
```

## The Transaction Model

```
/work "Add feature X"
    |
Goal node created (ID: N)
    |
Action node before each edit (links to goal)
    |
Implementation happens (Edit/Write now allowed)
    |
git commit
    |
Outcome node with --commit HEAD (links to action)
    |
deciduous sync
```

## Why This Matters

- **Hooks will block you** if no recent action/goal exists
- **Commits will remind you** to link them to the graph
- **The graph captures your reasoning** for future sessions
- **Context recovery works** because the graph has everything

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Start work
deciduous add goal "Feature title" -c 90 -p "User request"

# Before editing (required!)
deciduous add action "What I'm implementing" -c 85
deciduous link <goal> <action> -r "Implementation"

# After committing
deciduous add outcome "Result" -c 95 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <action> <outcome> -r "Complete"

# Always sync
deciduous sync
```

**Now create the goal node for: $ARGUMENTS**
